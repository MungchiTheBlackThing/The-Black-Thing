00;00;00;00,00;00;05;02,바람이 불어 잎새가 흔들리는 소리와 함께 나무의 긴 이야기를 들었어.,"Amidst the rustling of leaves, I listened to her lengthy tale."
00;00;05;02,00;00;09;25,나무는 기억나지 않을 정도로 오래 전부터 그 자리에 있었대.,The tree had stood there for as long as she could remember.
00;00;09;25,00;00;14;09,"자신을 제외한 주위의 모든 것들이 시들고 저물며, 재가 되고,","She saw everything around her wither, fade, turn to ash,"
00;00;14;09,00;00;18;05,끝내 다시 싹을 틔우는 것을 몇 번이고 보면서.,yet bloom again many times over.
00;00;18;05,00;00;22;10,나무는 지독한 외로움 속에서,"Seized with loneliness, she thought,"
00;00;22;10,00;00;26;15,‘언젠가 사라지는 한 줌의 것들은 모두 무의미하다’고 생각했어.,‘All minute things destined to disappear are meaningless.’
00;00;30;12,00;00;34;12,"그러던 어느 날, 나무는 눈빛이 반짝이는 작은 인간을 만났어.","Then one day, the tree met a small human with sparkling eyes."
00;00;34;12,00;00;38;15,인간은 나무를 매일매일 찾아왔지.,The human visited the tree every day.
00;00;38;15,00;00;43;16,"나무 밑동과 키가 비슷하던 인간 아이는 점점 자랐고, 어느덧 눈빛이 깊어졌어.","She was as tall as the tree’s stump. Then she grew, and her eyes became wiser."
00;00;43;16,00;00;48;06,그러다 다시 조금씩 작아졌고 머리가 하얗게 새기 시작했지.,She then grew smaller and her hair whiter.
00;00;48;06,00;00;52;13,"나무가 인간을 마지막으로 보던 날, 인간은 나무의 몸을 매만지며 ‘고마웠어’라고 말했대.","On the last day the tree saw the human, she caressed her trunk and said “Thank you.”
On the last day they saw each other, the human caressed her trunk and said ""Thank you."""
00;00;52;13,00;00;56;13,나무는 어느새 자신이 곧 사라져 버릴 인간을 사랑하고 있었다는 것을 깨달았어.,The tree realized she had come to love the human who would soon disappear.
00;00;56;13,00;01;00;20,그리고 나무는 다시 인간이 없는 긴 시간을 살아 내기 시작했어.,"And the tree once again began to live a long time without the human.
And the tree resigned once more to a long life without the human."
00;01;00;20,00;01;04;01,"참 이상하게도… 그 인간이 지나왔던 계절들,","But thinking she was amid all the seasons the human had lived through,"
00;01;04;01,00;01;09;00,인간이 사랑했던 꽃과 하늘의 한가운데에 있다고 생각하니 전처럼 외롭지 않았대.,"and all the flowers and skies the human had loved, the tree didn’t feel lonely anymore.
amid those beloved flowers and skies, the tree didn't feel lonely anymore."
00;01;09;00,00;01;14;06,나무는 알게 된 거야.,The tree had realized.
00;01;14;06,00;01;19;12,"무의미해 보이는 것에 의미를 부여하는 순간, 무엇보다 가치 있어진다는 것을.","Once you give meaning to what seems meaningless, it becomes invaluable."
