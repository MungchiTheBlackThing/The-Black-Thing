00:00:07:09,00:00:10:09,그래서 그는 구슬을 만드는 일을 했어.,So his goal was to make marbles.
00:00:10:09,00:00:13:12,쉬운 일은 아니었지. 완벽하게 꼭 들어맞는 구슬이어야만 했으니.,It was not an easy goal to achieve. His marble had to fit perfectly.
00:00:13:12,00:00:15:28,그는 집착적으로 매달렸어. 밤낮없이 도리없이 기약없이 매진했어.,"He clung to the task. Night and day, relentless and endless."

00:00:38:18,00:00:40:29,그러나 녹록지 않았지.,But it was not easy.
00:00:40:29,00:00:44:07,‘네 심장조차 나의 구멍에 딱 맞지 않잖아. 그럼 너는 날 사랑하지 않는 거야.’,"“Even your heart doesn’t fit my hole. You never really loved me, did you?”"
00:00:44:07,00:00:46:17,실연의 아픔에 젖은 채 그는 떠났어.,"Devastated, he left."
