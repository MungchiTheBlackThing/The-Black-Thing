00;01;21;29,00;01;24;16,‘삼켜. 삼켜. 삼켜. 삼켜야지. 삼켜야만 해.’,"""Swallow. Swallow... Don't let it out."""
00;01;28;20,00;01;32;03,"아이는 전부 삼켰어. 꿀, 꺽 넘어가며 그것들은 싱싱한 토사물로 쌓여 갔지만","The child swallowed them all. Gulp gulp gulp, fresh vile vomit piling up."
00;01;32;07,00;01;35;18, 아이는 뱉어 낼 수 없었어. 식도 속 형의 존재를 들킬까 봐 두려웠으니까.,but he dared not heave. In case they found out who lived in his esophagus.
