    m_Localized: "We all begin somewhere. Humans like to call it \u2018home\u2019.
      \nMy home was the moon. An ugly little lump of rock tied to the green-blue
      beauty of Earth, revolving only as closely as gravity allowed it to be.\r\nAnd
      so I feared sunlight. Sunlight begins from the Sun, whom not even the Earth\u2014much
      less the moon\u2014dares to gaze head-on. \nI feared the untouchable heat would
      so easily burn me to ashes.\r\n\r\nIts vast, pulsing radiance was horrifying.
      A force that would crush me into waste. Merciful to all, yet cruel to me and
      me alone."

    m_Localized: "\u201CNo matter how you struggle, child, my blessing could never
      be yours,\" the Sun whispers. The heartless declaration of a gentle tyrant.
      \nIt was painful, <name>, but I dared not resist.\r\nYet your warmth was different.
      In some ways, you did resemble the sun. But you were never cruel or heartless.\r\r\nThere
      were times when you <multiple0>\nAnd I would be seized with the strangest vision.
      A vision that your (passive: voice)(active: touch) was leading me to a playground
      \nwhere serene waves of heat shimmered along the breeze."

      \nYou never tried to scare away my shade.\n<multiple1>\n<multiple2>\n\nSo who
      cares, <name>. Does it really matter, being blessed?\r\r\nWhen your sunshine
      soaked the ground and I was embraced by the warm darkness of its shadow,\nI
      could dare to be insignificant. Dare to be worthless."

      treasure those unique moments, and our short encounter. \r\nAnd so I now dive
      into your sunlight, that gentle slumber. And I won\u2019t be afraid. Because
      it won\u2019t be the sun\u2019s, it will be yours.\r\nI will gladly give in
      and submerge,\r\nand be reborn as\n<multiple3>\n\nI\u2019m glad I met you.
      It was reeling, and it was freeing. \r\nLet us meet again, on a night after
      the sun brushes past\u2014in a dreamscape that resembles you and I.\nUntil
      then, <name>!"
