      home was the Moon. An ugly little lump of rock tied to the green-blue beauty
      of Earth.\nAnd so I feared sunlight. Sunlight begins from the sum, whom not
      even the Earth\u2014much less the Moon\u2014dares to gaze head on.\nI feared
      the untouchable heat would so easily burn me to ashes.\r\n\r\nIts vast, pulsing
      radiance was horrifying. A force that would crush me into waste. Merciful to
      all, yet cruel to me and me alone."

      be yours,\u201D the sun whispers. The heartless declaration of a gentle tyrant.
      \nIt was painful, <nickname>, but I dared not resist.\r\n\nYet your warmth
      was different. In some ways, you did resemble the sun. But you were never cruel
      or heartless.\r\r\nThere were times when you <multiple0>\nAnd I would be seized
      with the strangest vision. A vision that you were leading me to a playground
      \nwhere serene waves of heat shimmered along the breeze."

      could dare to be insignificant. Dare to be worthless."
