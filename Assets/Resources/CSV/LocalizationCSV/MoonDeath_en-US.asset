      home was the moon. An ugly little lump of rock tied to the green-blue beauty
      of Earth, \r\n\r\nMoon people love humans. The way a sunflower faces the sun,
      a scholar chases the truth, and the tide gives into gravity,\nthey follow the
      Earth and revolve around it. Creating dreams for humans, they try to protect
      their peace, their days and nights, and their vibrant colors that will never
      fade away.\nIt's a lonely kind of love. Not just a longing, but a blind kind
      of love."

      same.\r\nWhether I was destined to a single orbit, tied to humans by gravity.
      Just like the moon, where I began.\r\n\r\nBut <nickname>, you were different.\r\nYou
      knew I might one day be a dream of yours, yet you never considered me bound
      to you.\r\nYou never left me longing or blind. You called me a friend. \r\n\r\nOurs
      wasn\u2019t a one-sided love, like that of the moon and the Earth. \r\n\r\nNo,
      like one star and another, like a sunflower and a scholar, like the tide and
      the truth\u2014we were unrelated. Thus we were equals, our curiosity and fondness
      flowing back and forth."

      I. Until then, <nickname>!"
