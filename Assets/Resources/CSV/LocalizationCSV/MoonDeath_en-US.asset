      home was the moon. An ugly little lump of rock \ntied to the green-blue beauty
      of Earth, \r\n\r\nMoon people love humans. The way a sunflower faces the sun,
      \na scholar chases the truth, and the tide gives into gravity,\nthey follow
      the Earth and revolve around it. \nCreating dreams for humans, they try to
      protect their peace, \ntheir days and nights, \nand their vibrant colors that
      will never fade away."

      same. Just like the moon... where I began.\r\nWhether I was destined to a single
      orbit, tied to humans by gravity.\n\rBut <nickname>, you were different.\r\nYou
      knew I might one day be a dream of yours, \nyet you never left me lonely or
      blind. You called me a friend. \r\n\rOurs wasn\u2019t a one-sided love, like
      that of the moon and the Earth. \r\n\rNo, like one star and another, like a
      sunflower and a scholar, \nlike the tide and the truth\u2014we were unrelated.
      \nThus we were equals, \nour curiosity and fondness flowing back and forth."
