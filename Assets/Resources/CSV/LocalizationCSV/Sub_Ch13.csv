S13_L0001,"<nickname>, there was a machine\nthat died on a faraway planet,","<nickname>, 225억 킬로미터 떨어진 낯선\n행성에서 숨을 거둔 무생물이 있었대."
S13_L0002,225 million kilometers from Earth.,지구에서부터 225억 킬로미터.
S13_L0003,What do you mean?,"응, 그게 무슨 말이야?"
S13_L0004,I read about a robotic rover that rolled upon\nMars's silent sands for the longest time.,어떤 탐사 로봇에 대해 읽었어. 오랫동안 \n화성의 고요한 모래 위를 굴러다녔다던.
S13_L0005,"Opportunity, I think it was called?",이름이 '오퍼튜니티'였던가?
S13_L0006,Opportunity....,오퍼튜니티....
S13_L0007,And it lost connection with Earth.|And so it disappeared forever.,지구와의 통신이 끊겼구나.|그렇게 영원히 사라졌구나.
S13_L0008,...,...
S13_L0009,Yes. That is how it died.,맞아. 그것이 그의 죽음이었어.
S13_L0010,...Do you think it was afraid?,... 두려웠을까?
S13_L0011,When the feeling of nothingness crept\ntowards it with the weight of an eternity,억겁의 무게로 엄습해 오는 '무'의\n감각이 사지를 느리게 마비시키는 동안
S13_L0012,"and paralyzed its limbs one by one,\ndo you think Opportunity was afraid?",두려움을 느꼈을까?
S13_L0013,"Did it clutch onto the relativity of time,\nparalyzed in fear and silent as the desert,","시간의 상대성을 부여잡고, 공포에 굳어\n그 사막만큼이나 아주 아주 고요해진 채"
S13_L0014,"and pray and pray and pray, distraught\nand devastated and desperate,",그의 지루한 탐험이\n잠시라도 연장될 수 있기를
S13_L0015,"that its dull expedition would be\nprolonged, if only for a moment?","간절하고 간절하고 간절하고\n또 간절하게, 빌고 빌고 빌었을까?"
S13_L0016,But it's inanimate.|Maybe it felt at peace.,그는 무생물인걸.|오히려 평온을 느꼈을 수도 있어.
S13_L0017,All inanimate beings have life. They must\nbe living out their own relative time.,모든 무생물에는 생이 서려 있지. 그들 또한\n상대적일 그들만의 시간 속을 헤쳐 가니까.
S13_L0018,How?,어떻게?
S13_L0019,"Once it died, and Opportunity was\nfree of its metal lump of a body...","죽고 나면, 오퍼튜니티가 그의\n고철 덩어리 육체를 벗어나고 나면..."
S13_L0020,"It could finally rest in peace,\nfree to fly about the universe.",편안하게 휴식하며 마음껏\n우주를 날아다닐 수 있을 테니까.
S13_L0021,"A new opportunity, of sorts.",그에겐 새로운 기회였을까.
S13_L0022,... Oh.,... 아.
S13_L0023,...,...
S13_L0024,"<nickname>, did Opportunity\nleave any last words?",혹시 그가 남긴 말이 있어?\n유언 같은 것 말이야.
S13_L0025,... I'll look it up.,... 찾아 볼게.
S13_L0026,...,...
S13_L0027,"... Yes, there was one.","... 응, 남겼네."
S13_L0028,"My battery is low and it's getting dark.”
It's getting dark...
It's getting dark.
They say sunsets on Mars are blue.
Before darkness settled on its eyelids\none last time, in that brief eternity,
Did it dream in blue?
Was Earth in its dreams?
...
I was sitting by the window yesterday. Some\npassersby were acting strange, though.
How so?
They put their hands together.\nIntertwined them, even.
Ah, you saw peoople holding hands. Lovers\ndo it, families do it... Anyone can, really.
Hold hands. Hold hands.\nDo you hold hands too?
Yes, if I'm close to someone.
How does it feel?
It's sweet and thrilling.|It makes me feel safe.
My heart starts beating to the\ndistant rhythm of love songs.
Side by side, two companions\nwalking in tandem.
It's fascinating how holding hands\ncan make your heart beat faster.
A heart that races with\nfeelings for someone...
Isn't the heart a critical organ for humans?\nWon't it be dangerous? What if it explodes?
I can't imagine. My heart is just a mushy\nglob that happens to beat regularly.
Your heart turns into a rainbow of colors too,\nremember? Like how watercolor paints paper.
I'm sure you're the only one\non Earth with a heart like that.
And what's really important is that\nour hearts follow our emotions.
A heart that follows emotions...
A heart that follows emotions to\nboldly change color or rhythm.
Does that mean my heart... can\nalso be that kind and brave?
It's a comfy, warm, and soft feeling.
My breathing calms, as if I'm\nfalling asleep to a lullaby.
It's fascinating how holding\nhands can do that.
Breathing that slowly calms from\ntouching someone you care for...
I think I can understand.
I feel a similar sense of\npeace when you stroke me.
Holding hands, hugging, stroking.\nThey're all expressions of affection.
Affection may not be special,\nsince we all exchange it.
But that's exactly why it <i>is</i> special.
How warm it feels that\nall life can give affection.
...Could I give affection to\nsomebody with these hands?
Could I give them peace?
With these small, sticky hands...
Red, Red. You're watching, aren't you?
How can I tell? Well....
Sometimes I can feel you tapping into my flat eyeballs.
I feel a warmth somewhere inside me, as faint as kitten whiskers.
.... Warm. Even now.
You know, Red. Humans sometimes write letters knowing they won't get one back.
And label them in many different ways.
A poem, a journal entry, an earnest prayer.
I cherish all those fruitless attempts and imitate them.
This—talking to you, all the way on the other side of the Moon—is something like that.
What do you think of my journey?
What was it like to gaze at humans from down there?
What were you expecting, and what were you disappointed by?
Did you ooh and aah at every encounter, and etch them under the sea of the Moon?
I know Edison will have.
If we ever meet again under the order of the universe, make sure you tell me all about it.
Oh, and something I've always meant to tell you since I was a black lump of goo.
Thank you for not giving up on me.
I recognized you the moment you recognized me.
Like you did with your human kid...
That you would be an unending flame to me as well.
Are you having trouble falling asleep?
How come you aren't going to sleep?
<nickname>, on one hand I\nhoped you'd stay awake with me
and share your thoughts throughout the night.
But not anymore. I know now how\nmuch humans need their rest.
I'd prefer you have a good night's sleep.
And if you don't dream, it will\ntrouble the Moon Beings too!
Huh?
A generously prepared gift needs to be received by someone.
So take your well-wrapped, squeaky-clean dream with grace, please.
(Now I know who to blame for nightmares.)|(Now I know to cherish my dreams.)
Alright, I'll try. But what do I do\nwhen I still can't fall asleep?
Hm... Hm... Hm Hm Hm.
<nickname>. Then I'll elongate my body to cover the window,
becoming a blackout curtain of sorts just for you. How's that?
(The Dot-out curtain...)
You'll drip. Won't it be sticky?|The window is too big, your body'll rip...
Hm... Will it?
Hm...! I guess it will.
......
Then I'll embrace my regret and stroke you with all my heart.
I won't let a speck of light touch a single strand of your snoozing hair.
With all my heart.
With all your heart?
Yes. That's how I\nwant to protect you.
I wish the blackest blackout\ncurtain would cover you.
So that... A comfortable scene of you and I can be drawn before us.
Now close your eyes, <nickname>.
