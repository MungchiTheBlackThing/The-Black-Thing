      it dream in blue?\r\nWas Earth in its dreams?\r\n...\r\nI was sitting by the
      window yesterday. Some\\npassersby were acting strange, though.\r\nHow so?\r\nThey
      put their hands together.\\nIntertwined them, even.\r\nAh, you saw peoople
      holding hands. Lovers\\ndo it, families do it... Anyone can, really.\r\nHold
      hands. Hold hands.\\nDo you hold hands too?\r\nYes, if I'm close to someone.\r\nHow

      starts beating to the\\ndistant rhythm of love songs.\r\nSide by side, two
      companions\\nwalking in tandem.\r\nIt's fascinating how holding hands\\ncan
      make your heart beat faster.\r\nA heart that races with\\nfeelings for someone...\r\nIsn't
      the heart a critical organ for humans?\\nWon't it be dangerous? What if it
      explodes?\r\nI can't imagine. My heart is just a mushy\\nglob that happens
      to beat regularly.\r\nYour heart turns into a rainbow of colors too,\\nremember?
      Like how watercolor paints paper.\r\nI'm sure you're the only one\\non Earth
      with a heart like that.\r\nAnd what's really important is that\\nour hearts
      follow our emotions.\r\nA heart that follows emotions...\r\nA heart that follows
      emotions to\\nboldly change color or rhythm.\r\nDoes that mean my heart...
      can\\nalso be that kind and brave?\r\nIt's a comfy, warm, and soft feeling.\r\nMy
      breathing calms, as if I'm\\nfalling asleep to a lullaby.\r\nIt's fascinating
      how holding\\nhands can do that.\r\nBreathing that slowly calms from\\ntouching
      someone you care for...\r\nI think I can understand.\r\nI feel a similar sense
      of\\npeace when you stroke me.\r\nHolding hands, hugging, stroking.\\nThey're
      all expressions of affection.\r\nAffection may not be special,\\nsince we all
      exchange it.\r\nBut that's exactly why it <i>is</i> special.\r\nHow warm it
      feels that\\nall life can give affection.\r\n...Could I give affection to\\nsomebody
      with these hands?\r\nCould I give them peace?\r\nWith these small, sticky hands...\r\nRed,
      Red. You're watching, aren't you?\r\nHow can I tell? Well....\r\nSometimes
      I can feel you tapping into my flat eyeballs.\r\nI feel a warmth somewhere
      inside me, as faint as kitten whiskers.\r\n.... Warm. Even now.\r\nYou know,
      Red. Humans sometimes write letters knowing they won't get one back.\r\nAnd
      label them in many different ways.\r\nA poem, a journal entry, an earnest prayer.\r\nI
      cherish all those fruitless attempts and imitate them.\r\nThis\u2014talking
      to you, all the way on the other side of the Moon\u2014is something like that.\r\nWhat
      do you think of my journey?\r\nWhat was it like to gaze at humans from down
      there?\r\nWhat were you expecting, and what were you disappointed by?\r\nDid
      you ooh and aah at every encounter, and etch them under the sea of the Moon?\r\nI
      know Edison will have.\r\nIf we ever meet again under the order of the universe,
      make sure you tell me all about it.\r\nOh, and something I've always meant
      to tell you since I was a black lump of goo.\r\nThank you for not giving up
      on me.\r\nI recognized you the moment you recognized me.\r\nLike you did with
      your human kid...\r\nThat you would be an unending flame to me as well.\r\nAre
      you having trouble falling asleep?\r\nHow come you aren't going to sleep?\r\n<nickname>,
      on one hand I\\nhoped you'd stay awake with me\r\nand share your thoughts throughout
      the night.\r\nBut not anymore. I know now how\\nmuch humans need their rest.\r\nI'd
      prefer you have a good night's sleep.\r\nAnd if you don't dream, it will\\ntrouble
      the Moon Beings too!\r\nHuh?\r\nA generously prepared gift needs to be received
      by someone.\r\nSo take your well-wrapped, squeaky-clean dream with grace, please.\r\n(Now
      I know who to blame for nightmares.)|(Now I know to cherish my dreams.)\r\nAlright,
      I'll try. But what do I do\\nwhen I still can't fall asleep?\r\nHm... Hm...
      Hm Hm Hm.\r\n<nickname>. Then I'll elongate my body to cover the window,\r\nbecoming
      a blackout curtain of sorts just for you. How's that?\r\n(The Dot-out curtain...)\r\nYou'll
      drip. Won't it be sticky?|The window is too big, your body'll rip...\r\nHm...
      Will it?\r\nHm...! I guess it will.\r\n......\r\nThen I'll embrace my regret
      and stroke you with all my heart.\r\nI won't let a speck of light touch a single
      strand of your snoozing hair.\r\nWith all my heart.\r\nWith all your heart?\r\nYes.
      That's how I\\nwant to protect you.\r\nI wish the blackest blackout\\ncurtain
      would cover you.\r\nSo that... A comfortable scene of you and I can be drawn
      before us.\r\nNow close your eyes, <nickname>.\r\n"
