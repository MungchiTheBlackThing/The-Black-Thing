      the word love itself. It can be everything, ergo it can be nothing!

      When
      I become a dream, I wished the world within me to be one so transparent, it
      won''t need words to love. A place where all emotions can unravel their tentacles,
      messy and chaotic.

      Will we then converse through light? Or yawns, or
      the shade of our pupils?

      And so, I wish to hold this nameless river
      of a world in my arms. A flowing, safe world.'
